It's 3 AM on a Tuesday night here and I've finally feel like I'm at a place where I can call this a website. 

Let me be clear though this is definitely not done. 

### Issues include: 

- An Actual Responsive Design
- SEO
- Various Accessibility Issues 
- General Optimization
- Add previous projects
- Fix tagging

In spite of all the above, the website is at least functional for the most part and I've learned a ton while making it!

The website is made with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages. I didn't want to use any sort of template or framework so the entire website has been made from scratch down to most of the UI elements. One big exception is the pdf renderer for my resume which uses [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), an amazing library that is used in Firefox.

Weirdest thing I got to take away from this process was seeing how far web development has come over the past decade even. I remember repeating a png to have a gradient background, but, considering some of the garrish colors I used, it may have just been me.
