excerpt: Why is Rasbian still 32 bit? 
mytags: Self-Hosting
---

For the past 3-4 years, I've relied on an aging Raspberry Pi as a server but it was only recently that I had to discover that Rasbian, the default OS for Raspberry Pi's, has been stuck on 32 bit. 
Services that I have used or wanted to use like Nextcloud News and Collabora Office now require a 64 bit enviroment which throws a wrench in my transition to self-hosting.
I've been stuck with a wiping it over with Ubuntu which does offer an ARM64 version or setting up something [evil](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/100926/64-bit-os-on-raspberry-pi-4/101802#101802) :/.
