It's 3 AM on a Tuesday night here and I've finally feel like I'm at a place where I can call this a website. 

Let me be clear though this is definitely not done. 

### Issues include: 

- An Actual Responsive Design
- SEO
- Various Accessibility Issues 
- General Optimization
- Add previous projects
- Fix tagging

In spite of all the above, the website is at least functional for the most part and I've learned a ton while making it!
