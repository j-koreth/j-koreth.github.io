I was running out of storage and I needed to migrate the Nextcloud installation to a 64-bit environment for Nextcloud News and Collabora. I had an old Dell laptop lying around and I decided to repurpose it as my new “server” for now. I know I’ve installed Linux Mint on it ages ago before reverting to Windows so I figured this would be a quick and painless process. I steered clear of Arch or Gentoo for time so I ended up trying to install Debian on it and then my problems started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a vague memory that the laptop’s wifi module was nonfree firmware and so had to opt for using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/&quot;&gt;Debian nonfree image&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t completely rule out the rest of my problems didn’t come from some curse by Stallman. I successfully booted up the graphical installer from the image and was initially relieved when I was able to connect to my Wifi on the networking step. As I got to the last screen, however, the installation froze. I tried it again and the same thing happened. Maybe I could’ve waited longer…? Who knows in the end. I moved to flashing Ubuntu and tried to install it again and I encountered similar issues with the installer freezing. I saw some users had some more success with networking disabled and voila, it made it to the end. I removed my flash drive, rebooted, and all I see is “Operation System Not Found”. Tried again and the same message popped up. I was about to give up when I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/questions/1683369/dell-xps-l5112z-on-boot-operation-system-not-found-after-ubuntu-install-but-af&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; which led me to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-legacy-server/releases/20.04/release/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; and the obscure 0 upvoted answer ended up solving headache. I’m not sure when Ubuntu stopped silently failing on devices on Legacy bootloaders nor do I know the difference between these two &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/UbuntuLegacy.png&quot;&gt;sections&lt;/a&gt; but it worked! It’s kind of ironic considering I used to have to &lt;em&gt;disable&lt;/em&gt; UEFI mode to get Linux working on other machines but I digress, at least this part is now over.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">$CURRENTYEAR is not the Year of Linux</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Found a New Side Project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/09/12/newproject.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Found a New Side Project" /><published>2021-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/09/12/newproject</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/09/12/newproject.html">&lt;p&gt;For the past 3-4 years, I’ve relied on an aging Raspberry Pi as a server but it was only recently that I had to discover that Rasbian, the default OS for Raspberry Pi’s, has been stuck on 32 bit. 
Services that I have used or wanted to use like Nextcloud News and Collabora Office now require a 64 bit enviroment which throws a wrench in my transition to self-hosting.
I’ve been stuck with a wiping it over with Ubuntu which does offer an ARM64 version or setting up something &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/100926/64-bit-os-on-raspberry-pi-4/101802#101802&quot;&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; :/.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why is Rasbian still 32 bit?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">So You’ve Made a Website.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/01/03/2021-1-3-second.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="So You’ve Made a Website." /><published>2021-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/01/03/2021-1-3-second</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/01/03/2021-1-3-second.html">&lt;p&gt;It’s 3 AM on a Tuesday night here and I’ve finally feel like I’m at a place where I can call this a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear though this is definitely not done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues-include&quot;&gt;Issues include:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Actual Responsive Design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SEO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various Accessibility Issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add previous projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix tagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the above, the website is at least functional for the most part and I’ve learned a ton while making it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is made with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages. I didn’t want to use any sort of template or framework so the entire website has been made from scratch down to most of the UI elements. One big exception is the pdf renderer for my resume which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/&quot;&gt;pdf.js&lt;/a&gt;, an amazing library that is used in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weirdest thing I got to take away from this process was seeing how far web development has come over the past decade even. I remember repeating a png to have a gradient background, but, considering some of the garrish colors I used, it may have just been me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I've (somewhat) made a website.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World!" /><published>2020-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/test</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/test.html">&lt;p&gt;So what is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this website to write about some of my side projects (and in part to hold myself accountable to finish them).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The beginning of the journey.
