I grappled with the question of arbitrary execution for a long time in my head. Most recently and relevantly there have been lots of talk on possible antitrust suits in order to open iOS devices to this. The pros are obvious and need not be said while the cons are more unknown for the general population as well as the developer community as these include the financial well-being of said companies who lose a ton of revenue (I realize apple is in no danger regardless of any such ruling) and also consumer confidence in the platform itself. Thereâ€™s a reason why people spend more money on iOS than on android and much more than desktop platforms. An example more relevant to our current discussion of videos games is in the case of the video game crash of the 80s. Common consensus concludes that this was the result of the poor quality of games that were available to buy for the Atari and I believe this was only emboldened by the lack of any restrictions on publishing a game as in the case of essentially all other video game systems since then.
